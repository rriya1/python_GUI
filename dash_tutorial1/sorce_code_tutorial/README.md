# Develop Data Visualization Interfaces in Python With Dash

This folder contains the source code developed in the tutorial [Develop Data Visualization Interfaces in Python With Dash](https://realpython.com/python-dash/).

The folder [`avocado_analytics_3`](avocado_analytics_3/) shows the final state of the source code.

The tutorial uses [`dash`](https://pypi.org/project/dash/) and [`pandas`](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/). You can install these packages by [creating and activating a virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) and then running `pip`:

```console
(venv) $ python -m pip install dash pandas
```

Alternatively, You can get an environment with the exact same versions of dependencies as the tutorial by installing from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

```console
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the file `app.py` to start your dashboard.
